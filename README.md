# Flexispot ESPHome

This project contains an ESPHome configuration file that will connect a ESP32 to the Flexispot E7 table. This can later be integrated with Home Assistant.

The esphome code was inspired by the amazing work done on [LoctekMotion_IoT](https://github.com/iMicknl/LoctekMotion_IoT). I have provided a template yaml for the Flexispot E7. For more information and examples check LoctekMotion_IoT's repo.
